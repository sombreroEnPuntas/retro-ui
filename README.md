<html>
  <head>

)
```

Detailed docs [here](https://sombreroenpuntas.github.io/retro-ui/)

## Development

This react library is made with `styled-components`.  
Uses `react-styleguidist` for docs.

### Scripts

```sh
yarn        # install deps :)
yarn start  # runs a styleguidist dev server with hot reload
yarn lint   # lint rules
yarn test   # run unit/integration tests
```

When updating docs, please re-build the docs page and commit the changes:

```sh
yarn docs   # builds a styleguidist docs page
```

To try out the library from a local build:

```sh
yarn build                      # builds for distributing as npm package
cd ../react-test-app            # navigate to a test project
yarn add file:../retro-ui/build # install the library from local version
```

To create a tag:

```sh
yarn release    # Generate a release with automated changelog, version bump and tag
```

### Local env

Styling and linting rules are enforced on local env. Requires `prettier` and `eslint`, as well as editor/IDE integration.  
Commit message format is enforced to adhere to conventional commits.  
Don't worry, there's feedback from the tools when trying to commit ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Ÿ

### CI & Releases

- DeepScan & CodeClimate keep an eye on tech debt and give automated PR reviews
- On every push to `master` branch, Github pages will publish the website in `docs/` folder.
- On every push, CI runs linting and unit/integration tests.
- On every new `master` tag, CI will build the library and publish it to NPM.

## Contribute

Yes please!

### TODO

- Dump all my components from other projects here :)
- eject `crapp`
- Global resets & fonts via styled-components

---

- is styleguidist making sense, or switch to storybook?
  - Better stories, including types
  - Is it possible to source stories from tests?

---

- Write meaningful e2e tests (wdio?)
